Description
###########

The tripexPro is a set of python codes developed for processing the data from
the vertically pointed radar.  The data is processed at two levels, as described 
by `Dias Neto et al. (2019) <https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-845-2019>`_ . 
At the first level, the data from the tree radar is resampled to a reference grid.
At the second level, the data is corrected for atmospheric attenuation, calibrate 
the reflectivities at the top of the clouds, and define a set of quality flags. 

Version
#######

This package is still under development, and it still needs additional 
modification in order to be used in a different setup.
